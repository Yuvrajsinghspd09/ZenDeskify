### IT Support Ticket System

This project is a simple IT Support Ticket System that helps manage support tickets better. It allows users to submit tickets, assigns them to IT owners, and prioritizes them based on several factors. The system also provides a dashboard to track tickets and analyze performance.

### What This Project Does

1. **Ticket Priority**:
   - Tickets are ranked based on their severity, priority, and how long they have been open.
   - Sentiment from the ticket description also affects the priority.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Analyzes the description of the ticket to check if it's positive, neutral, or negative.
   - This helps decide how urgent a ticket might be.

3. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Shows all tickets sorted by priority.
   - Displays stats about ticket distribution and how different IT owners are performing.
   - Helps track average resolution times.

4. **IT Owner Assignment**:
   - Automatically assigns tickets to IT owners based on historical data.

5. **Data Handling**:
   - Prepares ticket data by cleaning and processing it to make predictions or generate insights.

6. **Machine Learning**:
   - Uses a simple model to predict how long a ticket might take to resolve based on past data.

### How It Works

- Users can submit tickets through a form.
- The system analyzes the description and assigns a priority.
- IT owners are assigned automatically based on past records.
- Tickets are stored in a database for tracking and analysis.
- The dashboard shows all ticket details and performance metrics.

### What Can Be Added in the Future

- Analyzing descriptions for more detailed insights and providing steps to avoid recurring issues.
- Sending notifications when tickets are submitted or resolved.
- Better predictions using larger datasets.
- Adding a feature to recommend solutions for common issues.

This project is a good starting point for managing IT support tickets and understanding ticket trends.
